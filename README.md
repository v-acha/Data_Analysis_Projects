Welcome to my Data Analysis Project repository! Here, you'll find projects covering different topics and datasets. Explore various analyses, visualizations, and findings derived from real-world data. These projects showcase my abilities in working with data, creating visual representations, and drawing meaningful insights. Whether you're interested in trends, patterns, or insights, there's plenty to discover and learn from in these projects.

1. [Climate Analysis](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Climate_Analysis)
   - **Description:** This project examines climate anomalies and conducts a comparative analysis between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data analysis and visualizations.
   - **Results:** The comparative analysis between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere revealed significant differences in temperature patterns, with the Northern Hemisphere generally experiencing higher temperatures.

2. [Clinical Disease Analysis](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/clinical_disease)
   - **Description:** This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing harmful genetic mutations to understand their relationships with diseases and genes.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python(Pandas for preprocessing and cleaning, Altair and NetworkX for network graphs to show relationships between genes, diseases and mutation values.)
   - **Results:** Three Tableau dashboards presenting all mutations, top 15 mutation values, associated diseases and more. 
   - **Tableau Dashboards:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanellsa.acha/viz/HarmfulMutations/AllGeneticMutations 

3. [X (Twitter) Engagements and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/tweets)
   - **Description:** Analyzed tweet data from a user's Twitter account to uncover insights on activity patterns, sentiment, and engagement to optimize tweet strategies for better interaction.
   - **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, TextBlob, Tableau
   - **Tableau Dashboard:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanellsa.acha/viz/TweetEngagementandSentimentAnalysis/TweetActivity#1
   - **Results:** Identified peak tweet activity times (11 AM to 3 PM on weekdays), highlighted high-engagement hashtags (dataviz, d3js), and revealed trends in sentiment, guiding strategic recommendations for content planning and posting schedules.

4. [Baseball Metrics](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/baseball_stats)
   - **Description:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of MLB statistics using MLB-StatsAPI and pybaseball package, managing over 2GB of data from 2018 to 2024 by breaking it into yearly chunks. Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize individual pitch-level and seasonal data, providing valuable insights into baseball performance. Initially a group project for a visualization class, I expanded it with additional dashboards to further explore baseball analytics.
   - **Tools Used:** Python, Tableau, MLB-StatsAPI, pybaseball.
   - **Deliverables**
      - Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize run expectancy, batting averages, and pitching metrics.
      - Created a detailed data dictionary to assist users in understanding baseball metrics.
   - **Tableau Dashboard:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanellsa.acha/viz/Baseball_17216957934700/RunExpectancy 
   - **Website:** I built website using html, css, javascript and python flask to host our group's visualizations.
